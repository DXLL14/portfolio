    <p class="intro">Hello! I'm Rendell</p>
    <p>
      I know your time is limited, and your colleagues might be calling you right now...but I insist and risk my time not to bore you!
    </p>
    <p>
      My name is Rendell and unlike most "Virtual Assistants", I'm not going to take money from you.
    </p>
    <p class="highlight">
      It's About Giving <strong>Free Services</strong> To You!
    </p>
    <p>
      And I want to do this in the form of giving my time for you within 5 days considering I only need to work 3 hours per day part-time. I will do any job order you want and show you what skills I got and make your life easier and better before you met me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yes, there is no agenda to get you to hire me and pay me within that period. You don't need to.
